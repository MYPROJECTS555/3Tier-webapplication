git the project from https://github.com/SHRIDHARMUDASHI/E-Commerswebsite.git
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-- chown -R www-data:www-data E-Commerswebsite

                                       this is command is used to give the permission folder  E-Commerswebsite. basically we are cloned project has  a root user. we have to give the permission to apache users

Explaination for the command:
                     

--changes the ownership of the directory named E-Commerswebsite and all of its contents (files and subdirectories) to the user www-data and the group www-data.



chown           : Stands for "change owner"; it's used to modify the owner and/or group of files or directories.

-R              : The recursive flag. It applies the ownership change to the specified directory and everything inside it (all subdirectories and files).

www-data:www-data: 

                   The part before the colon (www-data) is the new owner user.

                   The part after the colon (www-data) is the new group.

E-Commerswebsite   : The target directory to apply the ownership change. Note that Linux is case-sensitive, so the directory name must match exactly as listed.

--------------
If you build a website, giving the web server (www-data) ownership of all your site’s files helps avoid problems. 
This makes sure the server can open, change, or display your website without getting blocked by file permissions. 
In short: the website works smoothly because the server has the access it needs.

realtime example:
drwxr-xr-x 6 www-data www-data 4.0K Aug  1 03:28 E-Commerswebsite


we can use any user:group you want, but usually www-data is chosen because web servers often run as that user. Choose the right user and group for your setup and needs!

Examples:

If you want to set ownership to a user named alice and a group named webusers, you would use:


chown -R alice:webusers E-Commerswebsite
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
step 2 :

giving the permission like read write and execute

for example :
drwxr-xr-x 6 www-data www-data 4096 Aug  1 03:28 E-Commerswebsite    // it has all permission

if the folder ther doesn't  have read write and execute permission 

run this command :  chmod -R 755  E-Commerswebsite

make sure we have to give proper permission before hosting web server on ec2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

step 3 

creating virtual host :

                        A virtual environment is like a separate little workspace on your computer where you can run and build your web application safely.It keeps your project’s files, tools, and libraries separate from everything else on your computer. This way, different projects don’t get mixed up or cause problems with each other.


for example: if we hosting web application using apache web browser on ubuntu os.

goto below path and edit the file

vi /etc/apache2/site-availability/E-commersewebsite.conf   -here are we are creating the E-commersewebsite.conf  inside siteavailibility.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E-commersewebsite.conf    - we have to configure 

<VirtualHost *:80>                                         // this  is apache port number or webrowser port number.  

    ServerAdmin admin@example.com                          //if we have any admin credential we can give here

    DocumentRoot /var/www/E-CommerceWebsite                // this is project path . E-CommerceWebsite contain all website itms.

    ServerName example.com                                //  here we have to give the domain name . if we don't have any domain name . aws will give free and default domain name  when we host the ec2 instance.
                                                              we can fid the default DNS name inside ec2 configure . then replace example.com to below public DNS  name
                                                               Public_DNS :   ec2-13-60-223-60.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com 

    ServerAlias www.example.com                            // here giving domain name with www , here we have to then replace example.com to below public DNS  name
                                                               Public_DNS :   www. ec2-13-60-223-60.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com 
                                          

    <Directory /var/www/E-CommerceWebsite>                it will go to inside E-CommerceWebsite and 
        Options +FollowSymLinks                            create the symbolic links
        AllowOverride All                                   taking all permission  and take grant and execute all files and displya the page.

     Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log                during access the file if we found any error  that will be stored inside the error.log . or application error
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined      here all user ip address will checked here , how many peoples are using the website.
</VirtualHost> 





thses are all are virtual host configuration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/E-CommerceWebsite
    ServerName ec2-13-60-223-60.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com
    ServerAlias www.ec2-13-60-223-60.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com

    <Directory /var/www/E-CommerceWebsite>
        Options +FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if we browser domain name we will not get website page . because we just created a virtualbox , we have to enable it. 
to enable run below command 

a2ensite  E-commersewebsite.conf  // means apache2 enable site 'virtualbox file name'.

a2enmod rewrite                      //  this command is used to give the permission to read and write
systemctl restart apache2.service     //  serivce is restarted we can acess the web site
