-- chown -R www-data:www-data E-Commerswebsite

                                       this is command is used to give the permission folder  E-Commerswebsite. basically we are cloned project has  a root user. we have to give the permission to apache users

Explaination for the command:
                     

--changes the ownership of the directory named E-Commerswebsite and all of its contents (files and subdirectories) to the user www-data and the group www-data.



chown           : Stands for "change owner"; it's used to modify the owner and/or group of files or directories.

-R              : The recursive flag. It applies the ownership change to the specified directory and everything inside it (all subdirectories and files).

www-data:www-data: 

                   The part before the colon (www-data) is the new owner user.

                   The part after the colon (www-data) is the new group.

E-Commerswebsite   : The target directory to apply the ownership change. Note that Linux is case-sensitive, so the directory name must match exactly as listed.

--------------
If you build a website, giving the web server (www-data) ownership of all your siteâ€™s files helps avoid problems. 
This makes sure the server can open, change, or display your website without getting blocked by file permissions. 
In short: the website works smoothly because the server has the access it needs.

realtime example:
drwxr-xr-x 6 www-data www-data 4.0K Aug  1 03:28 E-Commerswebsite


we can use any user:group you want, but usually www-data is chosen because web servers often run as that user. Choose the right user and group for your setup and needs!

Examples:

If you want to set ownership to a user named alice and a group named webusers, you would use:


chown -R alice:webusers E-Commerswebsite
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
step 2 :

giving the permission like read write and execute

for example :
drwxr-xr-x 6 www-data www-data 4096 Aug  1 03:28 E-Commerswebsite    // it has all permission

if the folder ther doesn't  have read write and execute permission 

run this command :  chmod -R 755  E-Commerswebsite

make sure we have to give proper permission before hosting web server on ec2.
